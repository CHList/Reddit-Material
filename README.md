# Reddit-Material
A Lightweight Reddit client built on top of Material Design Lite.

Reddit Material is a very small and lightweight Reddit client that allows users to browser subreddits and view threads/discussions.


It is very simple in it's original form as it can only display the original post and/or show the linked content.


This was a need-based personal project that I do not plan on expanding as current functionality fits my needs. The code is out
here as someone may want to use and expand it and maybe make it full-featured client.
